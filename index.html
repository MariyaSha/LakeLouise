        <p>Lake Louise is known for its turquoise, glacier-fed lake. Ringed by high peaks and overlooked by a stately chateau.
        Hiking trails wind up to the Lake Agnes Tea House for bird's-eye views.
            There's a canoe dock in summer, and a skating rink on the frozen lake in winter.</p>

                            <p>The Canadian Rocky and Columbia Mountains are home to both grizzly and black bears.
                               You can run into a bear anywhere here, be it on a busy trail close to town or in the remote backcountry.
                               Bears generally prefer to avoid people. However, encounters between bears and people do occur.
                               Knowing how to avoid an encounter with a bear is the best way to enjoy the parks, safely.</p>

                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> Use noise makers (i.e. air horns), throw sticks, rocks and sand at the wolf, to scare wolves away.
                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> If the wolf displays aggressive behaviour, back away slowly, do not turn your back on the wolf.

                               Elk can be aggressive and attack without warning. During the fall mating season (Aug - Sept) male are particularly belligerent.
                               During the spring calving season (may - June) female elk aggressively defend their young.
                               DO NOT approach elk in any season as they are DANGEROUS.
                            </p>

                                <span>&#8226;</span> Always keep a safe distance away from wildlife. We recommend keeping 30 metres,
                                or 3 bus lengths, away from elk for safety.
                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> If an elk becomes alert or nervous, grinds its teeth or sends its ears back, you're too close - back off.

                                Moose are the largest members of the deer family as well as the tallest land mammals in North America.
                                Attacks on humans by moose are rare, but can occur, especially when a female is protecting her offspring.
                                Vehicle collisions are also a major safety concern associated with moose.
                            </p>
                            <h5>If you see a moose</h5>

                                <span>&#8226;</span> Never approach a moose. Give the animals a wide berth and ensure they always have an escape route.
                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> Be aware of moose body language. A threatened moose may lower its head and flatten its ears before charging. If you see these behaviours, calmly find an escape route.

                                Bison are wild animals. Even though they look docile they are dangerous, unpredictable, and may charge without warning.
                                Approaching bison is unlawful and puts yourself and others at risk.
                            </p>
                            <h5>If you see a bison</h5>
                            <p>
                                <span>&#8226;</span> Keep at least 100 metres (330 feet) away from Bison at all times, even when you are in your vehicle.
                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> Avoid approaching bison where their escape routes are limited; they may charge more readily.
                                <br><span>&#8226;</span> If you encounter bison while hiking, don’t try to approach or scare them away. Make them aware of your presence, if they don’t move off- walk well around them, always keeping an eye on them. If necessary, return to the trailhead.

                                Rams are known for charging and headbutting each other. They will also try to attack humans in some circumstances.
                                You can walk toward a ram that begins to back up, stand your ground and dodge an attack, or wrestle it to the ground.
                                Some ways to avoid an attack include keeping your eyes on the ram, avoiding petting a ram, and keeping your head up.
                                Rams can be dangerous so if you don’t know how to handle yourself, it is best to stay away from them.

                                Geese are territorial birds and are known to chase or attack humans who disturb their territory.
                                While geese may chase people, an actual physical attack is fairly rare.
                                You can stop a goose's aggression by respectfully leaving its territory.
                                Back away slowly, while remaining calm. Do not do anything that may escalate the situation, like yelling.
                                In the event you are injured, seek medical attention to assess your injuries.
